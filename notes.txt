PROJECT THREE NOTES
- full files and subset files (.subset.fastq.gz)
- trim reads with low quality bases or remove adapter contamination
    - bowtie2 is not capable, so we have to do this step (trimmomatic)
    - trimmomatic -> Bolger et al.
        - single-end
        - java -jar trimmomatic-0.35.jar SE -phred33 input.fq.gz output.fq.gz ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-

        - default
- four bigwigs for every sample
    - every bin in the genome and a count
    - quality control check
    - plot the correlation of the quality of bins between samples
        - describes relatedness between samples
        - expect inputs to be roughly similar to each other
    - generate a visualization
        - density of signal at different points to see where most of binding is occurring
        - example: deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/plotProfile.html
        - plotting the binding of our factor
- same qc steps, add samtools flag step, multiqc
    - comment about the quality we see
    - hinted that there might be something weird...
- p calling with HOMER
    - on perform peak calling twice on the two replicates
    - manipulate channel to only run twice on the two replicates
    - creates a text file that needs to be converted to BED file
        - region files
        - use bedtools to come up with a single peak
- single set of consensus peaks
    - remove any region that overlaps the blacklist regions
    - EVEN A SINGLE BASE PAIR
- look for enrichment in the genes that these peaks are annotated to
    - use the peaks to look for repeated factors sequence
    - known motifs can tell you what your factor is or the binding of other factors
