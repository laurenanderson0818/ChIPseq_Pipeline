    "#### Methods\n",
    "We obtained samples from the NCBI GEO unders the accession number GSE75070. The data was for immunoprecipitated (IP) samples and matched input control samples. We assessed the quality of the raw read data with defualt paramters of FastQC v0.12.1 [Andrews, 2010], which allowed us to check sequence quality and GC content. We trimmed adapters and low quality bases with Trimmomatic v0.39 [Bolger et al., 2014] using default parameters. We then aligned the trimmed reads to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using default parameters of bowtie2 v2.5.4 [Langmead & Salzberg, 2012]. After aligning, we performed another quality check with samtools flagstat v1.21 [Heng et al., 2009] at default parameters. We combined all of the quality control metrics using MultiQC v1.25 [Ewels et al., 2016] with the default parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the output from the bowtie2 alignment to create HOMER tag directories using HOMER v5.1 [Heinz et al., 2010] and the default parameters. We identified peaks using HOMER and the default parameters before defining reproducible peaks using bedtools intersect v2.31.1 [Quinlan et al., 2010] where intersecting peaks from both replicates required a 50% reciprocal overlap. Then, we converted the reproducible peaks output from a (.pos) file to BED format using HOMER's pos2bed. We removed any peaks from that list that overlapped with the hg38-blacklist using bedtools. We then annotated the final set of reproducible peaks and identified motifs using HOMER.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we sorted and indexed the aligned BAM files using default parameters of samtools v1.21 [Heng et al., 2009]. Then, we produced BigWig files from the sorted and index BAM files using the bamCoverage function in deeptools v3.5.5 [Ramírez et al., 2016] with the default parameters. We generate signal coverage plots using the computeMatrix function in scale-regions mode with 2000bp above and below the TSS and TTS. We obtained the genomic coordinates for hg38 genes from the UCSC genome browser by extracting the human (GRCh38, Dec 2013) UCSC RefSeq (refGene) annotations. Finally, we generated a pearson correlation plot with multiBigWigsummary and plot correlation deeptools functions run with the default parameters."

    "#### Quality Control Evaluation\n",
    "The reads for IP_rep1, IP_rep2, and INPUT_rep1 were all equal at around 30 million reads. The sample INPUT_rep2 was sequenced to a lower depth with around 10 million reads. Since this sample was random background data, it was determined that the significantly lower number of reads was still acceptable. According to flagstat, all samples aligned at greater than 80%, which is reasonable and suggests good alignment. After trimming, we observed that a few million reads were removed, which was expected for this experiment. The phred scores look good across all reads, but there was an observed change in GC content. Since this is a binding experiment, we expect a change in GC content since the binding of TFs can change the GC content. The two different sample types (IP vs. INPUT) exhibit two distinct GC content curves, which is expected due to the difference in the sample groups. The sample IP_rep1 has many duplicates, which is expected due to the small length of sequence being observed. The INPUT files would not expect duplicates because they are randomly sampled across the genome. We expected to see high similarity in sequences where the same factor is binding which leads to duplication. There are no significant overrepresented sequences or contamination. Overall, I believe the experiment was of high quality and was suitable for downstream analysis."

    "#### Signal Coverage Plot\n",
    "The signal coverage plots represent where the binding signal in IP samples is located in the sample. In both rep1 and rep2, we observe the largest spike in signal before the transcription start site (TSS). This data makes sense and lets us hypothesize that RUNX1 is a transcription factor because it is binding near the TSS region. This is in line with our expectation that RUNX1 is a TF and the signal coverage plots support that conclusion."

    "#### Motif Finding\n",
    "RUNX1, FOXA (FOXA1/FOXA2), FOXM1, and GRHL2 were the top motifs found after the analysis. These results make sense because they are all transcription factors. Similarly, these factors being the resulting motifs suggests that they may be interacting with RUNX1. These factors could also be binding in the same place as RUNX1, which is why they matched the motif search. Finally, these factors were also found to act as chromatin-opening factors, similar to the function of RUNX1."

Similarly, in the gene NEAT1, we observe a higher concetration of peaks on the left hand side of the gene, which is also seen in the paper.

    "Do you observe any differences in the number of overlapping genes from both analyses? \n",
    "Yes, I observe differences in the number of overlapping genes from both analyses. However, the general trends are the same in that all categories have less than 30% overlap and there is generally more overlap +/- 20kb of the whole genome than +/- 5kb of TSS. These differences may have been caused by the different genomic windows that we are observing. For example, since the whole genome is much broader than the TSS region, it may include additional overlaps not present in the TSS region leading to the greater number of overlaps and differing number of overlaps. Second, there may be differences in the annotation version that led to different labelling of each peak and ultimately changing whether an overlap was observed/noted or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "We combine these two analyses because it allows us to tell the difference between direct promoter-level RUNX1 regulation (+/- 5kb) from more distal or indirect RUNX1 influences (+/- 20kb). The +/- 5kb analysis tests if RUNX1 binds near the TSS where it directly regulates transcription initiation while the +/- 20kb genome analysis captures broader regulatory relationships. The two analyses give a complete picture of how RUNX1 binding contributes to differential gene expression. One conclusion this allows us to draw is whether RUNX1 directly regulates transcription through the promoter. If a larger percentage of differentially expressed genes have +/- 5kb RUNX1 peaks, it suggests direct transcriptional regulation. However, given that we have similar number of overlapping peaks, it can be assumed that transcriptional regulation occurs throughout the genome."

    "Yes, I observe differences in my results compared to what is found in the paper. In general,the number of overlapping peaks is relatively the same, but the number of genes in rep1 and rep2 vary greatly from those in the paper. There may have been differences in the peak calling software or parameters that led to the differing values in the venn diagram. Another explanation for these discrenpencies is that the read alignment and annotation varied between the samples, changing what may be considered an overlap or what certain peaks may be classified as."

    "I performed an Enrichr enrichment of the peaks found within the promoter region by subsetting the peaks data to include only peaks found in the promoter and entering these genes into the Enrichr interface. Overall, DNA replication and cell cycle pathways appeared as top hits across multiple databases from Enrichr, indicating their importance in IP samples (DNA Strand Elongation, S phase, DNA replication, and Cell Cycle). Cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolic pathways also show strong enrichment, indicating that RUNX1 may play dual roles in both metabolic regulation and cell proliferation. Overall, the enrichment  suggests the analyzed peaks correspond to binding sites of a TF, or chromatin modification involved in cell cycle progression. These are some expected results given the the cancer context of this study."
